/**
 * Generates the Fibonacci series up to the nth term and returns
 * a string describing the nth Fibonacci number and the full series.
 *
 * The Fibonacci sequence is generated using iteration, starting
 * from 0 and 1, and each next term is the sum of the previous two.
 *
 * Example:
 *   fibonacciSeries(5) â†’ "At the 5th position, the Fibonacci Number is 3 and the series is 0,1,1,2,3"
 *
 * @param {number} n - The number of terms in the Fibonacci series (must be >= 2).
 * @returns {string} A string indicating the nth Fibonacci number and the complete series.
